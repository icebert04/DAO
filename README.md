# DAO (from [learnweb3.io](https://www.learnweb3.io/tracks/sophomore))

## Things that I've learned..

* Launched a **DAO** for NFT holders to create and vote on proposals
* Built a **DAO** Treasury
* Created a **FakeNFTMarketplace** for purchasing the NFTs
* Used **Hardhat** for smart contract deployment, as well as importing **Openzeppelin's Ownable Contract**
* Got API keys from **[Alchemy]**(https://dashboard.alchemyapi.io/) and **[Rinkeby Faucet]**(https://rinkebyfaucet.com/)
* npm install **Web3Modal library** in order to connect dApp to the **Metamask** wallet
* Have voting options for "Yay" or "Nay"
* Used **Next.js** static page for NFT holders to create, vote, and view proposals using their **Metamask** wallet

Here's a screenshot of the basic **DAO** minting site that I've built..
